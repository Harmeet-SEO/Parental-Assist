          After three days of wandering the city, Luna, a domestic tabby cat,
          miraculously found her way home.

          Her owners, the Thompsons, were overjoyed and surprised when she
          appeared on their porch early Tuesday morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luna had been missing since Friday evening after slipping out the back
          door unnoticed.
